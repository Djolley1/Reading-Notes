What is functional programming?

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects

What are the benefits of a pure function?

- Predictability and reliability
- Easy to test
- Easier to debug and refactor

What is immutability?

- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

What is Referential transparency?

- a key concept in functional programming that refers to the property of an expression or function where it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior.

What is a module?

- a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates a set of related functionalities.

What does the word ‘require’ do?

- a fundamental mechanism for importing external modules or libraries into a program in various programming languages, enabling code reuse and modular development

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

- Import the mmodule and require it

What do we have to do to make a module available?

- After defining and exporting the module, you can then import it into other files or projects using the appropriate import mechanisms provided by the language or environment.
