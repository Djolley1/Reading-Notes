The margins, padding & borders make the site look way more put together (I need to add them to my page) & more professional. Arrays make code more simple if you need to code a phonebook let's say you can make an array of names and phone numbers instead of a bunch or else or if's. It's all really important for the developers code style and makes it better for the team to pick up where you left off.
