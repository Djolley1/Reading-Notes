How do you make a ragout sauce? Ingredients:

1 pound (450g) ground meat (a combination of beef and pork works well)
1 onion, finely chopped
2 carrots, finely chopped
2 celery stalks, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup (120ml) red wine (optional)
1 cup (240ml) beef or vegetable broth
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
Olive oil for cooking
Instructions:

Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.

Add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery to the pot. Sauté the vegetables until they become softened and the onions are translucent.

Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.

Add the ground meat to the pot, breaking it apart with a spoon, and cook until browned.

Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it simmer for a few minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook off.

Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a couple of minutes to enhance its flavor.

Add the crushed tomatoes, broth, bay leaves, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.

Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let it simmer gently for at least 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the more flavorful it will become.

Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a bit more broth or water.

Remove the bay leaves before serving.

Serve the ragù over your favorite pasta, polenta, or rice. Additionally, you can garnish it with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs for extra flavor. Enjoy your homemade ragù!


Teach me a new scale on the guitar. C (Root)
D (Whole step up from C)
E (Half step up from D)
F (Whole step up from E)
G (Whole step up from F)
A (Whole step up from G)
B (Half step up from A)
C (Whole step up from B, completing the octave)
Now, you can play the C Dorian mode on the guitar using the following frets on the low E string (assuming your guitar is in standard tuning):

C (8th fret)
D (10th fret)
E (11th fret)
F (13th fret)
G (15th fret)
A (17th fret)
B (18th fret)
C (20th fret)


Teach me how to change the oil in my car. Materials and Tools Needed:

New oil filter
Sufficient amount of the appropriate motor oil
Oil filter wrench
Oil drain pan
Jack and jack stands or ramps
Socket set and/or wrenches
Funnel
Oil filter drain tool or old rag
Disposable gloves
Oil filter disposal bag or container (check local regulations)
Step-by-Step Procedure:

Gather Materials: Ensure you have all the necessary materials and tools before you begin.

Prepare the Car:

Park the car on a level surface.
Allow the engine to cool, or run it for a few minutes to warm up the oil slightly. Warm oil flows more easily, making it easier to drain.
Lift the Car:

Use a jack and jack stands or ramps to lift the front of the car. Ensure it is safely secured before getting underneath.
Locate the Oil Drain Plug:

The oil drain plug is usually located on the bottom of the engine oil pan. Consult your owner's manual to identify its exact location.
Place the Oil Drain Pan:

Position the oil drain pan under the oil drain plug.
Remove the Drain Plug:

Using a socket wrench or box-end wrench, carefully loosen and remove the oil drain plug. Allow the oil to drain completely into the pan.
Remove and Replace the Oil Filter:

Use an oil filter wrench to remove the old oil filter. Be prepared for some additional oil to drain out.
Before installing the new oil filter, apply a small amount of oil to the rubber gasket on the top of the filter.
Screw on the new oil filter hand-tight.
Replace the Oil Drain Plug:

Once the oil has drained completely, replace the oil drain plug and tighten it securely.
Add New Oil:

Locate the oil filler cap on the top of the engine.
Using a funnel, add the appropriate amount and type of motor oil as specified in your owner's manual.
Check the Oil Level:

Start the engine and let it run for a minute.
Turn off the engine and check the oil level using the dipstick. Add more oil if necessary.
Dispose of Used Oil and Filter:

Properly dispose of the used oil and oil filter at a recycling center or an auto parts store that accepts used oil.
Record the Oil Change:

Record the date and mileage of the oil change in your vehicle maintenance log.
