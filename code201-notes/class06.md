What are some advantages to creating object literals? JavaScript object literals are a powerful and convenient way to represent and manipulate data in a simple and flexible manner, which is beneficial for various scenarios, from rapid development to better code readability.
How do objects differ from arrays? Objects are suitable for dealing with named properties, whereas arrays are more appropriate for handling ordered collections of similar items.
Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation. Bracket notation is useful when you need to access an object's property dynamically or when the property name contains special characters, spaces, or starts with a number.

What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? this allows the humanAge method to reference the specific properties (name and age) of the dog object without hardcoding the object's name. This makes the code more reusable and adaptable to different instances of dog objects.
