1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? To create a basic link in HTML, you wrap the text or other content inside an anchor (<a>) element.

2. The href attribute contains what information? It contains the URL or the web address to which the link points. The href attribute specifies the destination of the link, indicating the resource or page the user will navigate to when they click on the link.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers? 
    - Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.

    - Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.

    - Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".

4. What is meant by “normal flow”? It ensures that your content is readable even if the user's using a very limited browser or a device such as a screen reader that reads out the content of the page.

5. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements? 
    - Block-level elements: Start on a new line and stretch the full width of their containing element, creating a "block" of content.
    - Inline elements: Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They flow within the content and do not force a new line.

6. ___ positioning is the default for every html element. "static" positioning

7. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element. 
    - An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow.
    - Rather than positioning the element based on its relative position within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides.

8. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning? 
    - whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

9. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation. 
    - A function declaration is a statement that defines a function and assigns it a name.
    - Function invocation refers to the process of executing or calling a function that has been declared.

10. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    - A parameter is a variable listed in the function definition.
    - An argument is the actual value that is passed to a function when it is invoked.

11. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    - Greater efficiency (Becoming a developer isn't easy but it's one of the best skills to have. But, being an efficient coder is THE skill too have in my personal opinion. So I take efficiency seriously and that's what I strive too be an efficient coder.)
    - Learning from fellow students (Tech is always changing which is why I chose the field iit will keep my mind moving. Being able to have a partner who knows more than me on certain subjects only makkes me a better developer and hopefully I know more on certain subjects to make my partner better.)
