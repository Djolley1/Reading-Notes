Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
- You can control alignment in one axis, a row or a column, not both together as we can do in grid.

Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
- The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.
- The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.

How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
- The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. Anything which can change the order of items in flexbox or grid can cause this problem.

What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
- Flexbox is designed specifically for building flexible and dynamic layouts. It allows content to be dynamically arranged regardless of the size of the container or the content.

How does this topic connect with your long term goals? 
-  Flexbox is a valuable tool for creating flexible and responsive layouts. Flexbox provides a way to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations creating websites and applications that offer a positive user experience across a variety of devices.
