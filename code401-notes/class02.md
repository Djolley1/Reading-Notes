Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

- Middleware is the glue that helps different software applications or components communicate and work together smoothly, kind of like a mediator.

Express the most popular ____ ____.

- Node web framework

Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

- You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order you like.
- You can structure the app in one file or multiple files, and using any directory structure.

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

- A module is a self-contained unit of software that performs a specific set of functions.
- modularity promotes cleaner, more maintainable codebases, improves development efficiency, and enhances collaboration among team members.

What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- 10.2.4

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

- npm install jshint

Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

- Just as we take precautions in life to ensure things work smoothly, tests do the same for our programs.

What are three expected benefits of testing

- many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in an initial development effort
- the same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
- although empirical research has so far failed to confirm this, veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling

Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

- forgetting to run tests frequently
- writing too many tests at once
- partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD
- poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

- Early Detection of Integration Issues
- Faster Feedback Loop
- Improved Collaboration and Team Productivity

What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

- Continuous Delivery ensures that software changes are always deployable to production
- Continuous Deployment goes a step further by automating the deployment process and releasing changes to production environments automatically without human intervention.

Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

- See GitHub as a massive library where people store and collaborate on their code.
