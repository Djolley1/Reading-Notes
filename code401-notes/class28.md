What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?

- The main intended use case for the useEffect hook is to handle side effects in functional components. This includes tasks like fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and setting up subscriptions or timers.

How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?

- The effect's logic runs after the component renders. It can be used to perform side effects that depend on the component's state or props. The logic specified inside the useEffect hook executes after the DOM updates, ensuring that any changes made within the effect are based on the most recent render.

What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?

- The return value from the effect's logic function is important because it is used to clean up the effect. This cleanup function runs before the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs due to a change in dependencies. It helps to prevent memory leaks and ensures that subscriptions, timers, and other side effects are properly cleaned up.
