How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

- The useReducer and useContext hooks work together to simplify state management in a React application by consolidating state logic and eliminating the need for prop drilling. useReducer manages complex state logic in a single function, making it easier to handle state transitions in a clear and predictable manner. By moving the state management into a reducer, you keep the components focused on rendering rather than managing state changes.
