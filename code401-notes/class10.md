# Class 10

Stack: The stack line works like this: Whenever someone arrives, they go straight to the front of the line, right behind the last person who arrived. When it's time to sell tickets, the cashier serves the person who just arrived. Then, they serve the person who arrived just before that, and so on, until everyone's been served.

Queue: The queue line, on the other hand, works differently. When someone arrives, they join the back of the line. The cashier serves the person at the front of the line first. Only when that person has been served does the next person in line get their turn, and so on.
