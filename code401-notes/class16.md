What is an EC2 Instance?

- An EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server in Amazon's cloud. It allows you to run applications, host websites, and manage databases, among other tasks, just like you would on a physical server.

Use Cases for EC2

- Web Hosting: You can host websites and web applications, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of EC2.

- Big Data Analysis: Run large-scale data analysis tasks using powerful EC2 instances to handle significant computational loads.

Reason to Use ECS Instead of Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com

- ECS (Elastic Container Service) provides deeper integration with other AWS services, enabling more seamless management and scaling of containerized applications within the AWS ecosystem.

Where to Find EC2 on the AWS Console

- On the AWS Management Console, you can find EC2 under the "Compute" section on the main services menu.

General Difference Between T2 Micro and XL

- T2 Micro: A small instance with limited CPU and memory, suitable for lightweight tasks such as running a small website or development environment.

- XL (e.g., T2.XLarge): A larger instance with more CPU power and memory, suitable for more demanding applications like data processing or high-traffic websites.

Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a Non-Technical Friend

- A "compute cycle" is like a tiny slice of time when a computer's brain (CPU) works on a task. Imagine it as a single heartbeat in the life of a computer, where something gets processed or calculated.

What is Elastic Beanstalk?

- Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and managing applications in the cloud. It handles the infrastructure, including servers and networking, so you can focus on writing code.

Relationship Between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk

- Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances to run your applications. It automatically provisions and manages these instances, so you don't have to deal with the underlying server setup.

Benefits of Using Elastic Beanstalk

- Simplified Deployment: Easily deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- Automatic Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on the demand for your application.
- Integrated Monitoring: Provides built-in monitoring and health checks for your applications.
